# Seqexec Docker Build Scripts

These are Docker build configurations for the Seqexec server application in both production and test environments for Gemini North. GS can be added if requested.

## Files

- `build_prod.sh` - Builds the production Docker image and extracts the compiled application
- `build_test.sh` - Builds the test environment Docker image and extracts the compiled application
- `Dockerfile.gn` - Production Docker configuration
- `Dockerfile.gn_test` - Test environment Docker configuration

## Usage

To build the production version:

./build_prod.sh


To build the test version:

./build_test.sh

Both scripts will:
1. Build a CentOS 7-based Docker image with Java 17, Scala, and all required dependencies
2. Compile the Seqexec application
3. Extract the compiled application to the `./output` directory

## Requirements

- Docker
- Sufficient disk space for Java/Scala builds
